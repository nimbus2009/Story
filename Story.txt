Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number 4, privet drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal. Thank  you very much.
They would be the last people you would expect to be involved in something strange or mysterious; because they couldn't just hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was a beefy man with little or no neck at all. But he did have a very large moustache. He was a director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.
Mrs. Dursley meanwhile, was a blonde thin woman with twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very handy as she spent her entire time spying over the neighbours, craning over fences.
